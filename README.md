# Portfolio Fron End
To run this project, you need the server as well. That can be found at: [braydenRyleyServer](https://github.com/BraydenGray416/braydenRyleyServer). The process for setting that all up will be over on that Git repository.
To begin the process of setting up this project, clone this down. Once it's on your computer, find it through your chosen Terminal, make sure that you have both Grunt and Node installed into your project and enter the following command into your server:
```
npm install
```
From here, open up the files in your chosen code editor and rename the **configExample.json** to **config.json** and you'll need to enter in your server URL and your server port which help the program run.

Once you've got this done, you should be good to go.
